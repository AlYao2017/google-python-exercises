These are my solutions as I go through [Google's Python Class](http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/index.html).

I'm just getting started with Python coming from Ruby, so there are a lot of
methods and idioms that I'm unfamiliar with. I will probably revise these
solutions as I continue to learn.
